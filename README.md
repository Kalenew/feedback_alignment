# Feedback Alignment

Tensorflow implementation of [Direct feedback Alignment Provides Learning in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01596).
and [Random synaptic feedback weights support error backpropagation for deep learning](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13276)

[DataDownload.ipynb](https://github.com/sangyi92/Direct_Feedback_Alignment/blob/master/DataDownload.ipynb) is for downloading notMNIST data. The code is from the [Tensorflow Udacity source code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb)

[DFA.ipynb](https://github.com/sangyi92/Direct_Feedback_Alignment/blob/master/DFA.ipynb) is the implementation of Direct feedback Alignment.
